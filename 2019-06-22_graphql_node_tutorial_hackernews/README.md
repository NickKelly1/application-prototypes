Overview (excerpt)

GraphQL is the rising star of backend technologies. It replaces REST as an API design paradigm and is becoming the new standard for exposing the data and functionality of a server.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to build an idiomatic GraphQL server entirely from scratch. You are going to use the following technologies:

graphql-yoga: Fully-featured GraphQL server with focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience. It is built on top of Express, apollo-server, graphql-js and more.
Prisma: Prisma replaces traditional ORMs. Use the Prisma client to implement your GraphQL resolvers and simplify database access
GraphQL Playground: “GraphQL IDE” that allows to interactively explore the functionality of a GraphQL API by sending queries and mutations to it. It’s somewhat similar to Postman which offers comparable functionality for REST APIs. Among other things, a GraphQL Playground…

… auto-generates a comprehensive documentation for all available API operations.
… provides an editor where you can write queries, mutations & subscriptions, with auto-completion(!) and syntax highlighting.
… lets you easily share your API operations.
